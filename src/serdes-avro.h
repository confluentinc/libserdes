/**
 * Serialize `avro` object into `*payloadp`.
 *
 * If `"serializer.framing"` is configured `schema` is required.
 * If `schema` is non-NULL the written object will be validated according
 * to the schema, if the validation fails SERDES_ERR_SCHEMA_MISMATCH
 * is returned.
 *
 * `payloadp` behaviour:
 *  - If `payloadp` is NULL no serialization is done but the required
 *    size of the payload buffer is returned in `*sizep`.
 *  - If `*payloadp` is NULL a buffer will be malloc(3):ed, it is the
 *    application's responsibility to free(3) this buffer when done with it.
 *  - If `*payloadp` is not NULL `*sizep` must be used to indicate the
 *    size of the `*payloadp` buffer.
 *
 * On success SERDES_ERR_OK is returned and `*payloadp` points to
 * the serialized payload, `*sizep` is set to the byte length of the payload.
 *
 * On error a SERDES_ERR_.. error is returned and a human readable
 * error description is writing to `errstr`.
